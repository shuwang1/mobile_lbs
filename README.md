# Location Based Services for Mobiles: Technologies and Standards

## Summary

Location based services (LBS) for mobile are the services supported by cellular networks to provide users with various location sensitive applications, including E911, Friendfinder, personalized advertisement, etc. LBS is accelerating the convergence of 3C (computer, communication and consumer electronics). One key aspect of LBS markets is the explosive growth of GPS (Global Positioning System) markets, which is estimated at USD 37.9 billion in 2017 and anticipate to reach USD 146.4 billion by 2025 at a CAGR pace of 18.4% (by Grand View Research, https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/gps-market). The driving force behind of the growth of LBS market includes IoT devices, auotomous driving, regulatorâ€™s mandates, the development of more efficient location technologies and the expanding of LBS from network operator to third service provider. The rapid development and widely adoption of assisted GPS (AGPS) is also believed to one of the keys to the success of LBS market, which are bringing huge revenue opportunities for wireless network operators and service providers.

In this set of slides, the state of art of mobile network assisted GPS and location based services (LBS) will be explored in terms of technologies, standards and implementations. There are four main topics to be discussed. Within the first part, an introduction to AGPS and LBS concepts is presented along with an overview of the growing LBS market. Two examples of LBS, E911 and telematics, are emphasized. In the second part, after a survey of wireless location technologies, an overview of GPS history and system architecture is presented. Along the explanation of GPS positioning, the error sources and signal link budget of GPS positioning are analyzed. It is then concluded that it is necessary to improve GPS positioning sensitivity and accuracy for ensuring the success of LBS.  An overview of AGPS techniques is discussed thereafter. In the third part, the implementation of mobile network assisted GPS is presented after an overview of the location services provided by mobile networks. The architecture and operation of the network-dependent LBS control plane of cdma2000 and UMTS networks are reviewed, respectively. A survey of the related standards by OMA, 3GPP and 3GPP2 is given. Finally, the challenges, further works and standard activities for mobile network assisted GPS and LBS are presented.

In summary, the slides are intended to provide a comprehensive overview of mobile LBS for a wide array of audiences, including LBS services providers, application developers, marketing managers and system researchers, etc. It includes not only the background information and standards activities but also some hand-on development examples.
